# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
	The main goal of this project is to introduce us to the actual, real world raw data and how we can convert this data to a meaningful, structured and accurate format. This is a subset of the challenges we have to face while analysing real world problem.

## Process
•	**Exploring: I start with deep diving into data to get the better understanding of the dataset. I start exploring the each table and then column of the table and try to be more familiar with it.
•	**Cleaning: Then I start with the cleaning process. Initially I start with the easy going cleaning which are easy to detect and fix. For example eliminating NULL valued rows, removing duplicate rows & columns, deleting null columns and as I spend more time in this process I gradually going towards the more deep and deeper cleaning. For e.g. I try to compare the column with the other columns in same as well as other tables. That makes me able to drop the invalid data and fill the missing values. Making the connection between that tables is tricky but equally important part of the process.
•	**Analysis: This is a step where I start answering the questions. Sometimes I again have to go back to the cleaning before giving the answer.

## Results
This analysis and dataset could be used to answer various questions. Some of them are as follows:
•	It provides the great information about the accessibility and popularity information of the website depends upon geolocations. For e.g. we can calculate the no. of pageviews, visitors, orders from all or particular city/country.
•	I also have information about the revenue generated and we can also categorised the revenue according to the location, products, product category, visitor and so on.
•	The data about the products could also be informatic. This could be used to compare the most popular and least popular products among visitors and helps to make decisions about the product management.

## Challenges 
•	**Missing values:- I realise that filling the missing values is not simple as it sounds. I could change the result of the analysis if went wrong.
•	**Connecting relations:- establishing connection between the table is trick. For this I have to make some assumptions therefore at some points I feel little uncertainty.
•	As you know from my introduction my quirky fact is I love to sleep. But I have to compromise it to complete this project. So body and time constraints was also a challenge for me.
## Future Goals
Time limitation is really a big challenge for me. If I could get more time I would like to do some more experiments with it like.
•	I would like to normalise the tables further.
•	Like to create probably more tables to distinguish the visitor information from the other table to find more facts about the characteristics of the visitors visiting the site.
•	I would also like to make the products table more stable and well connected with the other tables.
•	Revenue information is also inconsistent. I would like to fix it.
